# Notes related to lazyDom

Start out by reading these files:

 * @README.md
 * @ARCHITECTURE.md

If you need to work on a improving performance, also read
@PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md.

# Additional instructions
 * Tasks are not done unless tests, typecheck and linting all passes.
 * Remember to use the thunk approach for all calls that mutate data, since
   this is the main idea with lazyDom. Use the storage classes and create
   new ones where appropriate.
